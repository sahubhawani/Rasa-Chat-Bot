We have designed a ChatBot to help find Restaurants in Tier-1 & Tier-2 cities of India.
Basically, A user has to provide his/her desired location and preferred cuisine with their 
average 2 people budget to get the Top 5 restaurants in decreasing order of user ratings.
Also these details can be emailed which shows top 10 results.
Our Chatbot is trained on various intent and entities using the file data/nlu.md

Intents:
- Greet
- Restaurant Search
- Send Email
- Affirm
- Deny
- Goodbye

Entites:
- location
- cuisine
- email
- supported_location
- unsupported_location
- unknown_location
- min_budget
- max_budget

To get the list of supported and unsupported, we created a python program(CitiesList.ipynb)
We are using a lookup for 
- supported_cities
- unsupported_cities

Unknown Cities are identied through an action(action_check_location)
It flags all cities not belonging to supported and unsupported as "Unknown Cities"

Synonyms have been added for major cities
Regex for email and Affirmation has been created

Current Cuisines Available are:
Chinese
Mexican
Italian
American
Thai
South Indian
North Indian

Average Budget for 2 people has 3 categories available:
Lesser than Rs. 300
Rs. 300 to 700
More than 700

A total of 25 Stories have been created to cover all the cases

The Chatbot has been deployed to Slack
